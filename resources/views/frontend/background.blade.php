        <h3>About Mandera Municipality</h3>
        <p class="fst-italic">El-wak Municipality is located in Mandera County in the extreme North Eastern part of Kenya. The municipality is 169 Km from Mandera town which is the headquarter of mandera county.
             Elwak town lies halfway between Wajir and Mandera. It borders the Republic of Somalia to the East about 8km from the town of Boru Hache also known as El-wak Somalia. 
             The Municipality was established through a gazette notice Vol.CXX11.No 87 of 15th May 2020.
             It covers two wards namely El-wak North and South with an area of 814.10 sq Kilometres with a population of 60,732 people(54% female and 46% male) according to the 2019 population census. 
             El-wak means “The Wells of God’’ originating from many wells present in the town. 
             The wells date back to the 17th century and have since sustained the livelihood of the locals by providing water to generations. Elwak is known for its expansive white sands, a phenomenon which has earned it the name “White City.” 
             It is mainly covered by thorny shrubs and Prosopis Juliflora(mathenge) bushes. 
             The Municipality falls within arid and semi arid regions and its climatic condition is characterized by relatively high temperatures of 22 degrees celcius in July and a maximum of 42 degree celcius in February and March. 
             The long rains of 255mm peaks in Months of April and May while the short rains occur in October and November.
              The frequent droughts and harsh climatic conditions make it difficult to practice crop agriculture.
               Livestock keeping is thus the mainstay of economic activities in the area.
